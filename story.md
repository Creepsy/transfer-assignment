# The Merge That Should Have Never Happened
*- written by ChatGPT with slight adaptations*

Rachel sat frozen in front of her screen, her mind racing as the terminal flashed with error messages. She had just pulled down the latest updates from the repo and, without thinking, tried to merge her changes into main. What followed was a horrifying cascade of conflicts—lines of code that she’d never seen before, changes she had no idea existed, and dozens of files tangled in a mess of red markers. How had it gotten this bad? They’d all been working on different features, hadn't they?

She glanced over at her teammate, Alex, who was struggling with the same issue on his machine. They were both working on similar parts of the codebase—Rachel had been updating the UI, Alex was refactoring the backend—but they hadn’t talked in days. They’d each worked in isolation and now it was a disaster. It wasn’t just a few conflicts—it was entire sections of the app. Conflicts between endpoints, new features overwriting one another, and even essential functionality was now broken. If they’d been working in small, frequent increments and communicating better, the changes would’ve been easy to integrate. But they hadn’t. Instead, they had both worked off long-lived branches, diverging for days without syncing with main. Now, they were staring down the consequences of ignoring the very principles of trunk-based development: short, frequent merges directly into the trunk.
